# Bifurcations

The included notebook demonstrates visualizations of two dimensional dynamical systems. It depends primarily on `sympy` and `scipy` to solve the systems. It goes through a simple example of a linear dynamical system and then progresses to two nonlinear systems. It 

## Dependencies
The libraries required to run the notebook can be installed in a virtual environment with pip:

## Content

Below are the plots generated by the notebook.

Phase plane for the system:
$$f_0 = -x_0 -2x_1$$

$$f_1 = 4x_0 -x_1$$

Nullclines and fixed point for the nonlinear system:

$$ f_0 = x_0+x_1 $$
$$ f_1 = -x_0^2 -x_0 + x_1 $$

Nullclines and fixed point for the nonlinear system (with $c=0$):

$$ f_0 = c - x_0^2 $$
$$ f_1 = -x_1 $$
